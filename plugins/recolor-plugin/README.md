# capacitor-ai-recolor
A capacitor plugin for detecting color and change it with AI.
On-device object segmentation and recoloring for Capacitor apps. Change the color of any object in an image using native AI (ML Kit/CoreML) for maximum speed and privacy.

# Features & Idea
- Accurately masks and isolates objects (couch, car, clothing) in an image.
- Applies a target color only to the masked area, preserving shading and texture.
- All processing happens on the device. No image data leaves the user's phone.

Product visualization, interior design previews, virtual clothing try-ons.
